# Rust_Extract_Links

This code fetches an HTML page from the Rust programming language website, parses the HTML content, selects all anchor links (<a> elements), 
extracts their href attributes, and prints them out. It demonstrates how to make an asynchronous HTTP request, 
handle the response, and parse HTML content using the reqwest and select crates.
